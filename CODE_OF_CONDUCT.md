# Project Code of Conduct

## Introduction

This project and its community are dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or level of experience. We do not tolerate harassment in any form. 

## Expected Behavior

All community members are expected to behave in a respectful and professional manner. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind and considerate
- Showing empathy towards other community members
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community

## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community administrators are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Reporting Violations

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community administrator as soon as possible. You can find their contact information in the project's documentation.
